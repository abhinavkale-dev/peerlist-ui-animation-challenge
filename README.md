![Peerlist x Aceternity UI Challenge](/public/peerlist-challenge.png)

This project showcases my implementation of the Peerlist x Aceternity UI Animation Challenge, featuring modern UI animations and interactive components built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and various animation libraries.

## Completed Challenges

### ✅ Day 1: Gooey Menu
An interactive menu with a fluid, gooey animation effect that creates a smooth, organic interaction experience.

### ✅ Day 2: Dynamic Status Indicator
A status indicator component with dynamic animations that visually represent different states.

### ✅ Day 3: Animated Checkboxes
A to-do list with beautifully animated checkboxes featuring smooth transitions, strikethrough effects, and loading animations when toggling task completion status.

### ✅ Day 4: Animated Toggle Switch
A premium subscription toggle featuring smooth zoom animations when switching between Free and Premium plans. The component includes a seamless transition where "Monthly • Annual" text zooms in when selecting Premium, followed by Monthly/Annual options.

### ✅ Day 5: Shared Layout Tabs
A collectibles showcase with smooth transitions between different view modes (list, card, and pack) while maintaining shared elements and consistent animations across layout changes.
